Search by - English name, Sanskrit name, which series

If sanskrit returns result display this, otherwise search English, otherwise could not find result

Video for sun salutations, maybe nakarasana and tittibasana too - is that gonna be hard to do?

On the series search, it needs to display them in the correct order - assign each pose a numerical position value and then use .sort on results

Different series -

Sun Salutations??
Standing
Primary
Intermediate
Advanced A

Other properties could include, areas it's strengthening, areas it's stretching

Need to add search by position

Conditional rendering of results -

Array.length === 0 "no results found"
Array.length === 1 "full information, large image"
Array.length > 1 "grid display of results"

Show some random results on landing on the page?
